                    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                    <p>Games serve different purposes to different people, some play it for fun,
                        others for work, and as its adoption increases today it is clear that it is not
                        for a fixed category of people and should be made with considerations for
                        everyone. However, it is clear that people with disabilities are not fully
                        considered when designing them and in more recent times, they are considered as
                        an afterthought.
                    </p>
                    <p>Millions of people live with conditions that can affect their cognitive,
                        visual, motor, or auditory functions but this shouldn’t limit them from getting
                        access to or playing games. Making certain “small” accessibility choices
                        available suddenly opens these games up to an even larger audience and more
                        inclusive to disabled users.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Design Process</h3>
                    <p>To tackle this challenge, I started with user research, moved into the
                        ideation phase, analyzed guidelines to guide the design, followed by wireframes,
                        user interface design, , and finally high-fidelity mockup, evaluations and
                        iterations. More details on how I went through this process and the final
                        product are shown below.</p>

                <h2>DISCOVERY</h2>
                <p>Kicked off the discovery process by trying to establish the project goals,
                    understanding the user audience, their pain points, reviewing existing concepts,
                    and picking a design strategy.
                </p>
                <h3>User research</h3>
                <p>AApproaching the project with a user-centered approach helped me to devlop
                    empathy with users, and properly understand the target audience, know the
                    questions they have before trying to create solutions for them. This application
                    design aims to create a possible solution to address accessibility challenges in
                    current games. The limitations and challenges disabled users face when trying to
                    access desktop applications, and the assistive technology tools they use are
                    first investigated, then a solution that allows these tools to function
                    optimally is designed. Different devices, the gesture, interactions, and design
                    issues associated with them are also explored to design appropriate or optimal
                    solutions for those devices.
                </p>

                <h3>Personas</h3>
                <p>To put faces to the users, “get into their minds” , empathise with them
                    better, see things from their own perspectives, and accurately answer the
                    research questions, I created personas. The system was designed around 4
                    personas, with a focus on their impairments, the challenges they face while
                    interacting with systems, the assistive technology tools they use, and what
                    specific scenarios they’d use the system in.

                            mid-stage Parkison’s disease, and thus needs assistance performing tasks. Being
                            at risk of fall and loss of balance, his movements are constrained and he has to
                            stay at home for assistance which means he has limited interaction with people
                            outside of his family. Ahmid has recently started playing video games online to
                            increase his social interactions with people and make friends. He particularly
                            enjoys the chat function in games. He’s looking for a new game application that
                            has a collection of board games and also has the chat feature so he can add
                            players as friends in games and send or receive messages from them. He uses the
                            Tobii Eyetracker and Voice control feature to operate and navigate his devices.

                            Lack of proper surgery aftercare has caused damages to Lucy’s eyes after she was
                            treated for Congenital Cataract as a child. Her vision has gotten progressively
                            worse over time and her eyes have become very sensitive to light and blurry. She
                            uses the JAWS screen reader and the Voice Control feature on her phone, but she
                            sometimes gets frustrated using the voice control as she has to repeat some
                            commands multiple times because it can’t pick up her accent or she’s in a
                            crowded area. Lucy has just moved to Japan and is unable to download her
                            favorite game app on the new regions app store. She's found new games but they
                            are inaccessible and can’t be operated with Voice Control. She wants a game app
                            that allows the use of Voice control and allows her to adjust the display and
                            text settings to fit her preference.

                        <p style="max-width: 550px;">Ted was just discharged from the army after 6 years
                            of service after he developed Sensorineural hearing loss due to constant
                            exposure to extremely loud noises from gunfire and explosions on the field. This
                            has affected the loudness and clarity of the way he hears things and he has been
                            fitted for a hearing aid. He uses closed captioning when watching videos or
                            playing games online but has found that they are not very accessible. Playing
                            Borderlands 2, he found that the captions were too tiny, the white text was
                            blending into the background and pans across the entire length of the screen
                            making it difficult to read during heated combat. Ted has just set up a YouTube
                            channel to review games with a specific focus on their accessibility options.
                            He’s mostly reviewed combat games until now, but he’s looking to create content
                            for a wider audience. He’s looking for board games he can review.

                        <p style="max-width: 550px;">Carol was diagnosed with 4th stage Alzheimer's
                            about a year ago, and she currently lives in a nursing home. She has moderate
                            cognitive decline which means she has trouble remembering personal history or
                            moving around. Carol’s daughter has bought her an iPad and downloaded skype on
                            it so they can speak to each other every day. It’s taking her a very slow time
                            to figure out how to use the iPad herself as she thinks it’s too complex and has
                            too many options. Her daughter has increased the text size on the iPad and has
                            also turned on the Voice Control feature for her, but she’s wary about using it
                            as she thinks it’s listening in on her. Carol’s doctor has recommended she plays
                            puzzle games to keep her engaged, stimulated and combat cognitive decline. She
                            wants the game to have a simple interface without too many options so she
                            doesn’t get confused. Carol also wants a game she can play with her daughter in
                            the evenings, she wants the game to have a chat feature so they can send each
                            other messages.

            <p>By using the user personas, and looking at the user’s pain points,
                motivations, and core needs, I was able to come up with the core goals and
                define the functions of the proposed solution:
            </p>

            <h3>Core Goals</h3>
            <div class="flex-between">
                <div>
                    <h4><span class="number">1</span> Accessible</h4>
                    <p style="max-width: 300px;">Colors and design are inclusive and non-prohitive.</p>

                    <p style="max-width: 300px;">Features and elements to complete the main tasks
                        and goals within the application should be easy to find.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="container project-detail">
            <h2>IDEATING</h2>
            <p>The core idea of the design was to provide an overall aesthetic interface
                that kept the general playful and fun nature of games but still provided an
                effective and efficient way to allow users to achieve their goals. This was the
                general guide for the design choices for the entire application, and the first
                focus was to ensure that all the pages of the application had a consistent
                layout and the general navigation menu was repeated in the same order on every
                page (WCAG, 3.2.3). Different sketch options for the pages were explored, and a
                sketch with the navigation buttons, menu buttons, and page titles was at the top
                of each page was chosen. This ensured the menu options were easily accessible
                and the game options to be in the center of the screen, as they were the main
                focus. Also, this allowed users to quickly get all the information they needed
                even if they were just scanning through the page.
            </p>
            <h3>Initial Sketches</h3>
            <p>At this point, I started to think about how all of these could be integrated
                together, then sketch my thoughts of what I thought would work and analyze them
                testing different approaches. I explored different initial sketches, breaking
                down what could work from each one or what to take out. Some of the initial
                concepts can be seen below.</p>

            <p>Ahmid has Parkinson’s disease which makes it difficult for him to properly
                use some interactions like sliding to the left or right or having to press a key
                for an extended period of time. To improve his experience with the GameBoard
                system, all elements on screen i.e buttons, texts e.t.c have a minimum target
                size of 44 by 44 px (WCAG, 2.5.5) which makes sure every element can be clicked
                easily.</p>
            <p>Having blurry vision as an aftermath of Cataract, Lucy has had to make
                certain adaptations to how she uses any of her devices. She uses the JAWS screen
                reader, so it was important to add text alternatives for all images on the
                screen so it’s readable (WCAG, 1.1). Also, users can increase texts on screen up
                to 200% without losing content or functionality allowing them to find an
                appropriate size that works perfectly for them (WCAG, 1.4.4).
            </p>
            <p>Also, poor contrast between elements on screen makes it difficult for content
                to be seen or understood and it was ensured that texts and interactive elements
                have a color contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1. This guarantees that users who
                can’t see the full-color spectrum are still able to read and perform actions.
                Throughout the application, instructions for performing actions such as buttons
                or links were designed so they didn't have to rely solely on sensory
                characteristics such as shape or color, also every button had an icon as well as
                a label to describe its function (WCAG, 1.3.3).
            </p>
            <p>In games, colors are used very often as “bad” or “good” indicators and to
                represent different players or tokens. This can be a challenge for color-blind
                users who can’t see specific colors(Red, Green, and Blue), an option was added
                to the settings menu [see Appendix D] to allow users to select a different color
                mode based on the type of colorblindness they had, allowing the application to
                change the colors into a more suitable color for people with that type of
                colorblindness.</p>
            <p>Ted has sensorial hearing loss which affects the loudness and clarity of the
                way he hears things, so he relies on closed captioning for watching or viewing
                contents on the screen. A lot of captions in games are not very accessible and
                little work has been done in this area and there are no specific guidelines to
                follow. But, captions and subtitles are similar and are generally represented in
                the same way, that is, with text at the bottom of the screen. Looking at
                subtitles a lot of work has been done in this area and bodies like the BBC and
                Netflix have studied and provided recommendations for optimal subtitles to
                ensure they are accessible to all users, and they can be transferred to this
                context for captioning. The (BBC subtitle guideline, 3.1) has recommended that
                each line of a subtitle has 37 - 42 characters and only two lines are shown on
                the screen at any particular time (BBC subtitle guideline, 3.3). It is also
                recommended to aim to leave a subtitle on screen for a minimum period of around
                0.3 seconds per word (BBC subtitle guideline, 4.1).

            <p>Carol has Alzheimer's and often feels overwhelmed by having to deal with too
                many options on the screen. The (WCAG, 1.3) recommends designing content that
                can be presented in different ways without losing information or structure.
                Here, a simple layout that can be turned on in the settings (see Appendix D),
                that allows users to use the application without animations and less information
                on the screen was designed. To accommodate users with memory problems, there’s
                also a help button on every screen so users can always find information about
                what page they are on and what actions they can perform at any point in time.
                Following (WCAG, 2.4.2), each page has a title that describes what it is for so
                users are aware of where they currently are. The layout and navigation of the
                application are kept consistent through all pages in the same relative order
                (WCAG, 3.2.3). This helps users become comfortable so they can predict where to
                find things on each page.</p>

                    <p>Color is an important part of how content is represented, viewed, and understood, but this can pose a  problem for people with color vision deficiency or color blindness and can’t see a certain range of colors. It was important to find a color scheme that provides enough contrast between the text, content, and background. So that text and non-decorative images are legible for anyone including people with low vision or color deficiencies (WCAG, 1.4.3). </p>
                    <p>To ensure all the colors are distinguishable, a Palette with colors that are unambiguous both to colorblind and non-colorblind users (Okabe, 2008) was explored. Furthermore, a color blindness simulator application Sim Daltonism (Sim Daltonism, 2020) was used to look at the design from the perspective of a colorblind person and see what it looks like with different types of color blindness to ensure the colors selected were distinguishable and accessible. But it is not possible to completely cover all cases, so an option was included in the settings to allow people to select a color mode based on the type of colorblindness they have. </p>
                    <p>Keeping in line with (WCAG, 1.3.3), it was ensured that colors alone were not used to identify elements, instead a combination of color, icons, and labels were used for navigation and menu buttons. </p>
                    <p>A non - decorative and simple sans serif font “Manrope” was selected to use throughout the entire application. This Font is clean and modern which makes it legible but still looks fun to fit into the game aesthetic. Having a clear text hierarchy differentiating between the Page titles, subheadings and body was also important to help guide the user’s eyes on the flow of content on the page (see Appendix D).</p>

            <h3>Multi-Platform Accessibility</h3>
            <p>Mobile devices, i.e phones, and tablets have smaller screens and thus have
                limited space to properly display the same contents from a web application.
                Looking at the WCAG guidelines and how can be applied or transferred to mobile
                content, touch targets were made to have a minimum size of at least 9mm by 9mm,
                and targets that are very close to this minimum size have a small amount of
                inactive space surrounding them(WCAG, 3.2), so users can click on them easily
                without accidentally clicking something else and performing the wrong action.
                With the size of the screen being smaller, the size of texts and elements on
                screen has been reduced and this might become an issue for users with visual
                impairments to properly see what’s on-screen. Users can change the text size to
                one that fits their preference and can be seen clearly. In places where there
                are forms, i.e the settings page , the form fields - in this case, sliders are
                positioned below rather than beside their labels so there’s enough space for it
                (WCAG, 2.1).
            </p>
            <p>These devices are also usually touch-based and therefore accommodations have
                to be made for touch gestures. In places where users had to swipe to access more
                menus, an optional button was placed on the screen so users who have difficulty
                doing swipe gestures can still access this (WCAG, 3.3).</p>
            <p>Some users use assistive technologies and are constrained to a particular
                orientation view. Ensuring the design was responsive to both portrait and
                landscape mode so users can use whichever they are more comfortable with without
                issues was important (WCAG, 4.1).

            <h2>EVALUATION</h2>
            <p>A combination of the Think-aloud protocol and the Remote usability testing
                methods were used to carry out the tests and help with the collection and
                evaluation of data. Tested with users accross a range of demographics, age,
                computer proficiency level. The study had 6 participants, 2 participants had
                experience with using the Voice Control feature, 3 participants had used closed
                captioning while watching videos at some point, 1 participant had visual
                impairment myopia and wears glasses.The key things to be evaluated were the
                Usability, Findability, Accessibility of the application. The participants were
                asked to perform these tasks: Add Medication, Record body vitals, Record mood
                and symptoms, Read an article, Add appointment.</p>
            <p>The participants were prompted to speak aloud and voice their thoughts while
                completing the tasks, to enable me to take notes of their observations or issues
                with the app while observing the process, the sessions were also followed up
                with a semi-structured interview to further get participants' thoughts on their
                experience with the system, and suggestions for potential improvements. SUS form
                participants completed at the end of the session formed the quantitative data.
                An SUS score of above 68 is considered a good score in the aspect of
                effectiveness, efficiency and ease of use. However, a participant had stated:</p>
            <p><span class="quote">“Changing the color mode based on color blindness type is a nice addition,
                but it just really feels like changing the theme of the app. I don’t see it
                really making much of a difference.”</p>
            <p>To address this I updated the design of the color selection mode in the
                settings page to allow users select and replace the Red, Green, Yellow, and Blue
                used in the background of all the pages with a color of their choice that fit
                their preference and is unambiguous (see Appendix G). This ensured that each
                user had a color palette that worked well with their particular color
                deficiencies and didn’t just look like a filter had been put over the
                application.</span></p>

            <h2>REFLECTIONS</h2>
            <p>After the evaluation, it was observed that users found the app easy to use
                and they were able to achieve their goals after a short period of using it. If
                there was more time available, the next step would be to test with more users
                and gather more feedback based on actual use in day to day environments, and
                re-iterate the product to suit the needs of the users. A constant re-iteration
                process and and development would be implemented.</p>
            <p>By creating sketches, wireframes, and paper prototype, helped to properly
                visualize as well as get feedback early on; this helped me save a lot of time
                and resources in the long run. Also, working with and following established
                guidelines like WCAG and BBC from the start of the project, helped in finding
                optimal techniques to achieve the main aim, making the application accessible.</p>
            <p>Collaborating with a developer would help to better understand the
                possibilities of the product, and validate feasibility.</p>
