                    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                    <p>Cancer is one of the most chronic disease, people that have just been
                        diagnosed with Cancer often find theirselves being overwhelmed with all the
                        information, medications, procedures and symptoms they suddenly have to take
                        care of that it gets difficult to keep up with tracking them.
                    </p>
                    <p>These complex treatment process can be difficult to maintain and could lead
                        to problems like inconsistent drug use, missing appointments or not being able
                        to give proper information about symptoms severity to their doctors leading to
                        misdiagnosis. How can people be equiped with a tool that would help them manage
                        their health better?</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Design Process</h3>
                    <p>To tackle this challenge, I started with user research, moved into the
                        ideation phase, analyzed the information architecture of the app, followed by
                        wireframes, user interface design, visual branding and digital illustration, and
                        finally high-fidelity mockup, evaluations and iterations. More details on how I
                        went through this process and the final product are shown below.</p>

                <h2>DISCOVERY</h2>
                <p>Kicked off the discovery process by trying to establish the project goals,
                    understanding the user audience, their pain points, reviewing existing concepts,
                    and picking a design strategy.
                </p>
                <h3>User research</h3>
                <p>Approaching the project with a user-centered approach helped me to devlop
                    empathy with users, and properly understand the target audience, know the
                    questions they have before trying to create solutions for them. This path helps
                    with the process of trying to answer questions like:

                            <li>What will the product used for?</li>
                            <li>What is their motivation to use the product?</li>
                            <li>What are the problems users currently have?</li>
                        </ul>

                <h3>Personas</h3>
                <p>To put faces to the users, “get into their minds” , empathise with them
                    better, see things from their own perspectives, and accurately answer the
                    research questions, I created personas.

                        <p>Derek started chemotherapy a few months ago after being diagnosed with
                            cancer. He records his body vitals as one of the ways to keep track of his
                            health, he has been using the Notes app on his phone to record his body
                            temperature and weight. He also forgets things easily and sometimes forgets to
                            take his drug at the right time or forgets to use them totally. He currently
                            uses the alarm app on his phone to set reminders to take them
                        </p>
                        <p>He would like an app where he can add his medications easily by scanning the
                            barcode on the pack and getting reminders automatically when it’s time to use
                            them. He also wants to be able to record all of his vitals, keep track of them,
                            compare the data over a period of time and share with his doctor when he needs
                            to.

                            treatments to be harsh and has been experiencing some symptoms as a result. She
                            goes in to see her Chemotherapist weekly but she sometimes forgets how she had
                            felt or the level of severity of her symptoms at a particular time over the
                            course of the week, leading to her not getting the best diagnosis or treatment.
                            She also currently has to run all information and articles she finds online
                            through her doctor for confirmation.
                        </p>
                        <p>She wants an app where she can get reminders to keep track of her mood and
                            the symptoms she’s currently experiencing, compare the data over time and easily
                            share them with her doctor, and also provide her with new or top articles about
                            cancer, easily search through list of articles and save them or add them to her

                        <p>Ali’s doctor has recommended a number of surgeries to treat his Melanoma.
                            Before the surgeries, he has to set up appointments with his different doctors
                            first for consultations, to provide him with more information on the procedures
                            and decide on the best date for the surgery.
                        </p>
                        <p>It is currently difficult for him to keep track of all these appointments and
                            sometimes ends up mixing them up and going to the wrong place or showing up at
                            the wrong time. He wants an app that would help him record these and also send
                            him reminders leading to the time and date of the appointment.

            <p>By using the user personas, and looking at the user’s pain points,
                motivations, and core needs, I was able to come up with the core goals and
                define the functions of the proposed solution:
            </p>

        <div class="container project-detail">
            <h2>INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE</h2>
            <p>At this stage, I started looking at the best way to organize and categorize
                the features within the product, the best language and labelling to use to
                ensure that users are able to find features easily and increase the usability of
                the product.
            </p>
            <h3>Card Sort</h3>
            <p>In trying to make sure the product will be usable and users will get the best
                experience, some participants were recruited to take part in an online card
                sorting session to observe patterns, how people grouped things and what language
                they used.The information gotten from this card sort was used to get an idea of
                how the categories should be organized and what language to use.

        </div>

        <div class="container project-detail">
            <h2>DESIGN APPROACH</h2>
            <p>Looking at the defined functions and how the user’s will use the product,
                different media were considered to determine the best medium for this product.
            </p>
            <div class="flex-between">
                <img src="assets/IMG_0690 1.png" alt="">
                <img src="assets/Group 6977.png" alt="">
                <img src="assets/Untitled 1 1 1.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>As there will be a lot of activity during the day that requires the user to
                open the app and enter values or perform an action, the tablet might not be the
                best option as it is too large to carry around at all times. The smart watch is
                perfect for logging activities and getting reminders but it will be difficult to
                perform some of the other important functionalities as the screen is too small.
                It would work better as a secondary app but not as a stand-alone product. The
                screen of the mobile phone provides enough space for the functionalities to be
                displayed properly without difficulty and since most users will have their
                mobile phone with them through the day, it will be easier to get notifications
                reminders and act on them immediately. So the mobile phone was chosen as the
                best medium to go ahead with.
            </p>

            <p>Breaking down and analyzing the directions that existing health tracking
                applications have used helped me to find out what has worked for them, and
                things that didn’t work for them to further inform the design direction to take.
                Taking the successes from this application as well as some Donald Norman’s
                principle of interaction design i.e Visibility, Affordance, and Consistency, I
                was able to define the principles that would guide our design approach.

            <p>At this point, I started to think about how all of these could be integrated
                together, then wireframe my thoughts of what I thought would work and analyze
                them testing different approaches. I explored different initial sketches,
                breaking down what could work from each one or what to take out. Some of the
                initial concepts can be seen below.

            <h2>EVALUATION</h2>
            <p>A combination of the Think-aloud protocol and the Remote usability testing
                methods were used to carry out the tests and help with the collection and
                evaluation of data. Tested with users accross a range of demographics, age,
                computer proficiency level, if they’ve used similar apps or have a visual
                impairment to properly cover most of the basis of our target users. The key
                things to be evaluated were the Usability, Findability, Learnability of the
                application. The participants were asked to perform these tasks: Add Medication,
                Record body vitals, Record mood and symptoms, Read an article, Add appointment.</p>
            <p>The participants were prompted to speak aloud and voice their thoughts while
                completing the tasks, to enable me to take notes of their observations or issues
                with the app while observing the process. I conducted the test sessions using
                Maze which automated the collection of task completion times, user’s paths, heat
                maps, misclick rates so a combination of these and the SUS form participants
                completed at the end of the session formed the quantitative data. An SUS score
                of above 68 is considered a good score in the aspect of effectiveness,
                efficiency and ease of use, but I noted some barriers users had while using the
                app.

                <p>After the evaluation, it was observed that users found the app easy to use
                    and they were able to achieve their goals after a short period of using it. If
                    there was more time available, I would have worked on more design assets like:
                    an Onboarding screen, A walk through guide for new users. Also add features
                    like: Chat function with doctors, Ability to add a caregiver to monitor
                    patient’s activities.</p>
                <p>By working with users from the start to the finish of the project, I was able
                    to get to a final solution that could properly suit their needs. Creating
                    sketches, wireframes, and paper prototype, helped to properly visualize as well
                    as get feedback early on; this helped me save a lot of time and resources in the
                    long run.</p>
                <p>Collaborating with a developer would help to better understand the
                    possibilities of the product, and validate feasibility.</p>
                <p>Another step would be to test with more users and gather more feedback based
                    on actual use in day to day environments, and re-iterate the product to suit the
                    needs of the users. A constant re-iteration process and and development would be
                    implemented.</p>
