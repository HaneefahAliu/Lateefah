                    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                    <p>Existing facility management system and solutions are not designed with users
                        in mind as they do not provide residents with a way to perform complete end to
                        end management of tasks which makes users have to still use multiple
                        applications to perform their tasks. To overcome this challenge, we looked at a
                        tool that would automates all the major inconviniences of living in an apartment
                        for the residence, and seamless management of residential communities by
                        facility managers. The final solution would combine facility management with
                        fanatic user welfare.

                    <h3>Design Process</h3>
                    <p>I was brought on as a product designer and tasked with designing a solution
                        that would cover all these main challenges. With the user research and market
                        analysis already done, I moved straight into moved into the user interface
                        design, and prototyping. More details on how I went through this process and the
                        final product are shown below.</p>

            <h2>DESIGN APPROACH</h2>
                <p>Kicked off the design process by defining the core goals and key features of the application by looking analyzing information from the user research provided. 
                </p>
                <h3>Core Goals</h3>
            <div class="flex-between">
                <div>
                    <h4>1 Visibility</h4>
                    <p style="max-width: 300px;">Users need to know what all the options 
                        are, and how to access them immediately.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>2 Affordance</h4>
                    <p style="max-width: 300px;">As soon as a user sees something, 
                        they know how to use it.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>3 Simple</h4>
                    <p style="max-width: 300px;">Users are able to complete tasks 
                        with minimal clicks.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>By taking a look at user pain points, motivations, and core needs, I was able to come up with a list of initial features. However, one of the concerns with designing a “do-it-all” application with so many features is that it would become something like a Swiss Army Knife, it was important to focus on specific priorities and the list was distilled down to 6 main features. </p>
            <h3>Features</h3>
            <div class="flex-between">
                <div>
                    <h4>1 Dashboard</h4>
                    <p style="max-width: 300px;">· Quick access to important features</p>

                    <p style="max-width: 300px;">· Store: Groceries, Cooking gas <br>
                        · Bills: Electricity, Water, Internet, Dues</p>

                <div>
                    <h4>3 Security</h4>
                    <p style="max-width: 300px;">· Grant access to visitors <br>
                        · Request help
                        <br>
                        · Maintenance request</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="flex-between">
                <div>
                    <h4>4 Profile</h4>
                    <p style="max-width: 300px;">· User’s profile <br>
                        · Add oother residents of an household</p>

                <div>
                    <h4>5 Wallet</h4>
                    <p style="max-width: 300px;">· Hold money: for bill payments 
                        and purchases</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>6 Notifications</h4>
                    <p style="max-width: 300px;">· Messages, announcements
                        or notices.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <h3>Ideating</h3>
            <p>At this point, I started to think about how all of the 6 core feaatures could be seamlessly integrated with each other. I did an initial sketch and wireframed my thoughts of what I thought would work to properly visualize them and futher analyze them to see what wouldn’t. Some of the initial concepts can be seen below.</p>

            <h2>INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE</h2>
            <p>Next, I start to build out the information architecture and userflows. My goal with this process is to carefully think through and answer questions around how users would experience the app.</p>

                    <p>The  dashboard was designed to provide the user with the most important information as soon as they launch the app. With the Quick actions section, users had access to the most important features straight from the homepage and could quickly perform a task.

                    <p>Using a big, red button for the emergency made it easy for users to easily click in case of an emergency, howeve because of it’s size it could be tapped in error, this is reduced by having to click a second menu option before the call goes out and it can be canceled immediately with the cancel button. In line with making the application end-to-end or fully automated, residents can request for maintenance, create passes for their visitors or call the gate house from the app.</p>

                    <p>A combination of items in the store being grouped into categories and the search bar at the top of the page helps users navigate to or find items faster.

The cart can be accessed from the top of the screen where they can remove it, modify it or increase the number. From there, it's on to checkout, or back to the menu to add more items.</p>
                    <p>After placing an order, users are able to view the progress and status of their order. This would be paired with notifications so they can get alerts as their order progresses till it gets to them. All orders can be accessed from the homescreen. </p>
